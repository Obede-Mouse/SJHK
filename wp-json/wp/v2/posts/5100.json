The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2);\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This novel coronavirus was identified as a cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China and then gradually spreading to other parts of the world in pandemic proportions. It has affected almost every continent in this world, except Antarctica. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease in 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>TRANSMISSION<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our understanding of the mode of transmission is currently incomplete. Epidemiologic<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investigation in Wuhan at the beginning of the outbreak identified an initial association with a seafood market where most patients had worked or visited. The seafood market also sold live rabbits, snakes and other animals. The initial concept was that the virus originated from snakes, however, later studies proved that it had more similarity with bats. However, as the outbreak progressed, person-to-person transmission through droplets and fomites became the primary mode of transmission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How does Person-to-person transmission occur?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Droplet transmission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The virus is released in the respiratory secretions when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can infect others if they make direct contact with the mucous membranes. Infection can also occur by touching an infected surface and followed by eyes, nose or mouth. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. However, given the current uncertainty regarding transmission mechanisms, airborne precautions are recommended routinely in some countries and in the setting of specific high-risk procedures. Patients are thought to be most contagious when they have symptoms. Some spread might be possible before symptoms appear, but this is not thought to be a common occurrence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Other possible modes of transmission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study suggested that the virus may also be present in faeces and could contaminate<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">places like toilet bowls and bathroom sinks. But the researchers noted the possibility<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of this being a mode of transmission needs more research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February a Chinese <\/span><b>newborn <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was diagnosed with the new coronavirus just 30 hours after birth. The baby&#8217;s mother tested positive before she gave birth. It is unclear how the disease was transmitted &#8211; in the womb, or after birth. Recently in London, another newborn was tested positive for the coronavirus, marking what appears to be the second such case as the pandemic worsens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>CLINICAL FEATURES<\/b><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5103\" src=\"https:\/\/www.doctorshospitalsseguku.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/coronavirus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.doctorshospitalsseguku.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/coronavirus.jpg 850w, https:\/\/www.doctorshospitalsseguku.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/coronavirus-320x179.jpg 320w, https:\/\/www.doctorshospitalsseguku.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/coronavirus-768x430.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Incubation period<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact incubation period is not known.
